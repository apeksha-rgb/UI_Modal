In web development, a modal refers to a type of user interface (UI) element that appears on top of the main content, often used to capture user input or display information. Modals are typically used for things like forms, notifications, or additional content that requires the user's attention before they can return to the main content.

# Modal Example

## Overview

This repository contains a simple implementation of a modal dialog box using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The modal features a backdrop filter and uses `z-index` to ensure it appears on top of other content. The modal's visibility is controlled via JavaScript by adding and removing classes.

## Features

- **Backdrop Filter**: Enhances the visual appeal with a modern backdrop blur effect.
- **z-index Management**: Ensures the modal is always displayed on top of the main content.
- **JavaScript Class Manipulation**: Toggles modal visibility using `classList` to add and remove the `hidden` class.
  
CSS
Backdrop Filter: Applied using the backdrop-filter property to create a blurred effect behind the modal.
z-index: Ensures the modal is positioned above other content.
Hidden Class: Initially hides the modal, which is toggled via JavaScript.
